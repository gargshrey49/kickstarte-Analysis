# kickstarte-Analysis
## Overview
The overview of the project is to visualize the campaign outcomes for plays to support Louise to make the process of fundrasing easy for Louise for her play "Fever" easier by visualizing and analysing the data for esisting campagin outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis based on Launch Date Chart
In this portion of the analysis we took the data from all the given data set and filtered it in a pivot table to account only for the plays i.e . which are the theatre performances. Then we put them in order of years to see a clear perspective on the issue. We also divided them into three different categories of successful, canceled and failed to make the analysis more descriptive. We then sorted them out according to the months to show which months were suitable to carry on the campaign. We also used the MS Excel functions to create a graph for our pivot table to visualize the data we were able to filter according to our needs.
### Analysis Based on Goals Chart
In this part of the analysis process we used the mathematical capabilities of MS Excel to use the given data set in a way to suit the conditions of differnt goals the differnt campaigns were able to achieve. We used the COUNTIFS() function of Excel to filter the data in ranges where we can clearly differntiate it and calculate percetages of differnt statistics. In order to better visualize the dat we also created a graph to represent the same data we filtered and calculated the percentages for. 
### Challenges
The challenges faced during the analysis for both the parts included the need for extreme caution while putting in the conditions for the various formulae to calculate the percentages and to select the right vaiables for ifferent sections of the pivot tables. I had spenta lot of time putting them in and also correcting them where a mistake was made. 
## Results
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
According to the analysis done by me the fundrasing campaigns for plays over the years highly successful in the months of July and November. For higher amaount of funds needed the better time would be to do the campaign in November and if a lower budget of funds is required the campaign can also be done in the months of March and November. Tosupport my outcome I have attached the graph image below.

### Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
In this portion of the analysis the outcome that I have come to is that if we were to make a probable assumption about the success of the campaigns the lower budget campains proved to be successful in general and the campaigns with a higher budget were almost always successful but the data to support the same is very less thus a definite assumption cannot be made accurately. If we go striclty accoring to the data a higher budget play is most likely to have a successful campagin almost a 100% of the time. TO support this claim I have included the chart image below:
